# Email_Spam_Detection
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. We performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and applied tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words and special characters. A Bag of Words model was used to vectorize the text. Multiple classification models were tested, and the best-performing one was selected based on precision and accuracy.
