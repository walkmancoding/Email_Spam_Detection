# Email_Spam_Detection
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. I performed data cleaning, handled missing values, applied tokenization, stemming, removal of stop words and special characters. A Bag of Words model was used to vectorize the text. Multiple classification and regression models were tested, and the best-performing one was selected based on precision and accuracy.
